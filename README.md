# MASAutomation

Welcome to my Citrix Application Delivery Management (ADM) (formally: NetScaler Management and Analytics (MAS)) repository.

My repository keeps track of all Citrix ADM (formally: NetScaler MAS) Configuration Jobs I have created during my many adventures to automate NetScaler deployments and configurations. Furthermore I've imported some Stylebook examples which are created by a good friend of mine, Esther Barthel.

This repository will contain the different custom ADM Configuration Jobs to support automated enrollment for Citrix ADC (formally: NetScaler) deployments and configurations where the ADM is your centralized management system.

So right now it holds the demo scripts from my Citrix Synergy and Citrix TEX presentations to give you a head start at building your own automated configs for Citrix ADM to centralize your ADC infrastructure management!

If you are looking for the more automation stuff (like Stylebooks) and impressive PowerShell scrips that were shown during the presentations, please visit Esther Berthels GitHib repository at https://github.com/cognitionIT/NetScalerMAS to ensure you get the latest versions of those files!
